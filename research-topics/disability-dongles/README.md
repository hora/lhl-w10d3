# Disability dongles – Worksheet

You have 60 minutes _including a ten minute break._ 4 questions.
As a group, decide when in the 60 minutes you want to take your break.

Assign one member of your group as note taker, and another as presenter.

Then, individually, read the following article:
[https://www.vox.com/first-person/2019/4/30/18523006/disabled-wheelchair-access-ramps-stair-climbing](https://www.vox.com/first-person/2019/4/30/18523006/disabled-wheelchair-access-ramps-stair-climbing)

## Discussion questions

After having read the article above, discuss the following questions and keep
notes on your answers. Bullet points are fine.

You can keep the notes in a text file, a secret gist, a blank piece of paper, or
anywhere else, as long as you'll be able to share it with Horațiu when you're
done. Add a note also about who is on your team and what topic you're discussing
about.

1. Discuss the article. What did you find confusing and/or insightful?

2. The article mentions several examples of how social or environmental factors
   create accessibility problems. List three. (You may also think of examples
   beyond this article).

3. Compare and contrast how disabled and non-disabled people think about
   'disability dongles.'

4. A common expression in the disability community is "Nothing about us, without
   us." If this were a motto for designing web apps, how might we approach
   development?
