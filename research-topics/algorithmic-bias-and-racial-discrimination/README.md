# Algorithmic bias and racial discrimination – Worksheet

You have 60 minutes _including a ten minute break._ 4 questions.
As a group, decide when in the 60 minutes you want to take your break.

Assign one member of your group as note taker, and another as presenter.

Then, individually, read the following article:
[https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/24/racial-bias-medical-algorithm-favors-white-patients-over-sicker-black-patients/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/24/racial-bias-medical-algorithm-favors-white-patients-over-sicker-black-patients/)

## Discussion questions

After having read the article above, discuss the following questions and keep
notes on your answers. Bullet points are fine.

You can keep the notes in a text file, a secret gist, a blank piece of paper, or
anywhere else, as long as you'll be able to share it with Horațiu when you're
done. Add a note also about who is on your team and what topic you're discussing
about.

1. Discuss the article. What did you find confusing and/or insightful?

2. The algorithm discussed in the article was specifically designed to ignore
   race, yet still produced racist results. The article mentions several reasons
   why this is the case. List three.

3. Do you think algorithms can be objective? Why or why not?

    Hint: You may find it useful to think about the following questions:

      - Algorithms require data. Where does data come from? Who collects it? For
        what purposes?
      - Thinking about your midterm project, what sort of data does the project
        work with? Could there be other data related to your app that your app
        isn't working with? What effects might this have on the final app?
      - Who programs algorithms? What unconscious biases might they have?

4. As web developers, how might we build software in ways that minimize the risk
   of introducing racial bias into our algorithms?
