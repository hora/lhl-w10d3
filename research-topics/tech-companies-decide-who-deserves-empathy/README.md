**Content warning:** the article briefly describes the aftermath of terrorist
attacks, violence, and natural disasters.

## Discussion questions

After having read the article above, discuss the following questions and keep
notes on your answers. Bullet points are fine.

You can keep the notes in a text file, a secret gist, a blank piece of paper, or
anywhere else, as long as you'll be able to share it with your teacher when you're
done. Add a note also about who is on your team and what topic you're discussing
about.

1. Discuss the article. What did you find confusing and/or insightful?

2. The article mentions several examples of political decisions made by tech
   companies. List three.

   Hint: to say that something is 'political' is to say that it embeds or
   expresses certain ideas about what is valuable in society, what is desirable
   for the future, and who gets to decide those things.

3. Do you think, in general, that companies like Amazon, Facebook or Google
   create software _for_ other people or _with_ them? What might be different in
   the development process between these two approaches?

4. Think of the midterm project you worked on (or are currently working on) in
   week 6. Come up with three ways in which the app can be considered political.

   Hint: you may find it useful to think about these questions:

    - Who had a say in what features the app needs to have, and who didn't?
    - Who is likely to benefit from such an app, and who isn't?
    - What do people need to make use of the app? Who may or may not have access
      to those skills or resources?
    - What values does the app express about society or the future?
