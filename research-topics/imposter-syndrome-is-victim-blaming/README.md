# Imposter syndrome is victim blaming â€“ Worksheet

You have 60 minutes _including a ten minute break._ ZZZ questions.
As a group, decide when in the 60 minutes you want to take your break.

## Part 1

1. Assign one member of your group as note taker, and another as presenter.

2. If you're the note taker, create [a new secret
   gist](https://gist.github.com/) and copy the contents of this markdown file
   into it. As you go through the rest of the questions, answer them and take
   notes in the gist you just created.

   Hint: to copy the contents of this file, click the <kbd>Raw</kbd> button at
   the top right. Then, use <kbd>Cmd/ctrl + A</kbd> then <kbd>Cmd/ctrl + C</kbd>
   to select all the contents and copy them. Paste them into thew new gist file.

   Hint: Name your gist `worksheet.md` so that GitHub formats it correctly.
