# Imposter syndrome is victim blaming â€“ Worksheet

You have 60 minutes _including a ten minute break._ ZZZ questions.
As a group, decide when in the 60 minutes you want to take your break.

## Part 1

1. Assign one member of your group as note taker, and another as presenter.

2. If you're the note taker, create [a new secret
   gist](https://gist.github.com/) and copy the contents of this markdown file
   into it. As you go through the rest of the questions, answer them as a group
   and have the note taker keep notes of your conversation in the gist you just
   created.

   Hint: to copy the contents of this file, go to the [Raw view of this
   file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hora/lhl-w10d3/master/research-topics/imposter-syndrome-is-victim-blaming/README.md).
   After that, use <kbd>Cmd/ctrl + A</kbd> then <kbd>Cmd/ctrl + C</kbd>
   to select all the contents and copy them. Paste them into the new gist file.

   Hint: Name your gist `worksheet.md` so that GitHub formats it correctly.

3. Read the following article (20 mins):

After having read the article above, discuss the following questions and keep
notes on your answers. Bullet points are fine.
