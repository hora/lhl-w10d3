You have 60 minutes _including a ten minute break._ 4 questions.
As a group, decide when in the 60 minutes you want to take your break.

## Discussion questions

After having read the article above, discuss the following questions and keep
notes on your answers. Bullet points are fine.

You can keep the notes in a text file, a secret gist, a blank piece of paper, or
anywhere else, as long as you'll be able to share it with your teacher when you're
done. Add a note also about who is on your team and what topic you're discussing
about.

1. Discuss the article. What did you find confusing and/or insightful?

2. Going 'paperless' (digital bills vs paper bills, ebooks vs paper books, etc)
   is often seen as a 'green' choice. What makes this claim problematic?

3. Who contributes more to carbon emissions through the creation, storage or use
   of digital data?

   Hint: You may find it useful to think about the following questions:

    - Who is connected to the internet, and who isn't?
    - What devices and apps create data, and who uses them?
    - Who benefits from amassing data?

4. As web developers, what responsibilities might we have in terms of data
   collection, generation and storage when considering climate change?
