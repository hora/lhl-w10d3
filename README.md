Together with your group, read through the topics below, then pick one that
sounds interesting to you. Follow the link to a short reading and a worksheet
related to that topic.

## [Algorithmic bias and racial
discrimination](/research-topics/algorithmic-bias-and-racial-discrimination)

From the article:

> A widely used algorithm that predicts which patients will benefit from extra
> medical care dramatically underestimates the health needs of the sickest black
> patients, amplifying long-standing racial disparities in medicine, researchers
> have found. 

Read about how this happened despite the fact the algorithm's developers
excluded race data from their calcuations.

## [Commercial content
moderation](/research-topics/commercial-content-moderation)

From the article:

> Commercial content moderation ... describes one of the dirtier jobs on the
> corporate internet: reviewing and removing violent, racist, and disturbing
> content posted to social media sites like Facebook and YouTube and in the
> comments sections of brand-aware websites for consumer products.

Read about the hidden labourers that keeps the internet useable, and their
exploitative and dangerous working conditions.

## [Data centres and the
environment](/research-topics/data-centres-and-the-environment)

From the article:

> In 2016, it was reported that the world’s data centres used more than
> Britain’s total electricity consumption - 416.2 terawatt hours, significantly
> higher than the UK’s 300 terawatt hours. At three percent of the global
> electricity supply and accounting for about two percent of total greenhouse
> gas emissions, data centres have the same carbon footprint as the aviation
> industry.

Read about how increased data collection, storage and use is contributing to
climate change.

## [Disability dongles](/research-topics/disability-dongles)

From the article:

> Nondisabled people excitedly circulate [a new accessibility gadget], hailing
> it as a win for accessibility. Disabled people, meanwhile, roll their eyes at
> what disability advocate and design strategist Liz Jackson terms a “disability
> dongle”: “A well intended elegant, yet useless solution to a problem we never
> knew we had.”

Read about how nondisabled developers of technology make assumptions about
disabled people and their needs, creating expensive and unnecessary devices
instead of listening to the disabled community.

## [Imposter syndrome blames the
victim](/research-topics/imposter-syndrome-blames-the-victim)

From the article:

> What we call imposter syndrome often reflects the reality of an environment
> that tells marginalized groups that we shouldn’t be confident, that our skills
> aren’t enough, that we won’t succeed — and when we do, our accomplishments
> won’t even be attributed to us. Yet imposter syndrome is treated as a personal
> problem to be overcome ... rather than a realistic reflection of the
> hostility, discrimination, and stereotyping that pervades tech culture.

Read about how imposter syndrome blames victims instead of focusing on the toxic
environments that make them feel like they don't belong.

## [Tech companies decide who deserves
empathy](/research-topics/tech-companies-decide-who-deserves-empathy)

From the article:

> The people who run the Internet platforms are making calls about who they
> think is deserving of empathy. That makes their decisions thoroughly
> political.

Read about how companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon decide what violent or
tragic events get to count as 'serious' through their selective use of features
like People Finder, Safety Check or solidarity profile picture updates.
